# Udacity-Project-2
The file named "Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook (ipynb)" is a Jupyter Notebook completed from Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree.
The notebok goes through a mock A/B test for a website and consists of three parts:
    1. Data collected on the control and experimental website
    2. Hypothesis testing to determine if the experimental website outperforms the control website
    3. Regression analysis to determine if the experimental website outperforms the control website

The notebook concludes with a quick conclusion of the results.
